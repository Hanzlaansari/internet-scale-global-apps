# Multicloud Global Internet-Scale JAMstack Serverless Apps using Netlify, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, FaunaDB, MongoDB Atlas and other best of the breed Serverless and Cloud Native Technologies in Baby Steps

In this repository we will learn to develop full stack web and mobile global and internet scale applications using the Fourth Generation Application Model with the latest state of the art multicloud technologies. 

To get started read this article: [Client-serverless is the 4th generation application model](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3564264/client-serverless-is-the-4th-generation-application-model.html).


[Multicloud: Everything you need to know about the biggest trend in cloud computing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/multicloud-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-biggest-trend-in-cloud-computing/).

To get started with serverless first find out [what is serverless by watching this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkD53Uuz4Rk). Then read this [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing). 

We have selected these best of the breed multicloud serverless technologies to learn:

Notes:

For front-end development we will use JAMstack, React, Gatsby.js, and WebAssembly. You can get started learning these technologies from [Panacloud Bootcamp 2020](https://panacloud.github.io/bootcamp-2020/).

We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our code editor.

In the later part of this repo we will focus more on [bringing together and learning two great technologies: serverless and containers](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/serverless-and-containers-two-great-technologies-that-work-great-together/).

[Watch this docker tutorial before you start learning Google Cloud Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqMOX6JJhGo)

For serverless containers we will use [Gooogle Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) and [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) for serverless functions.


We will learn how to integrate different serverless cloud services, SaaS, and legacy applications using [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub), [Azure Event Grid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/), and [Cloud Events](https://cloudevents.io/). We will be do [multicloud messaging with the help of serverless functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY0cHfDhpF4)

We will use infrastructure as code to provision serverless services in any cloud with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Our NoSQL database of choice will be [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), for SQL database we will use [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) and [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/) for low latency access to app data and native QraphQL support.


For automating our workflows and CI/CD we will be using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

We will using JavaScript, Typescript and Rust as our development language of choice. You may learn Typescript from [this Panacloud repo](https://github.com/panacloud/learn-typescript) and Rust from [this book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

For microservices container development we will be using Express with Typescript which you can learn from [this Panacloud repo](https://github.com/panacloud/learn-typed-express). For microservices development which is computation heavy and performance is critical we will use [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper).
